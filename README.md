# Nulled.to-Server Emulator

Server Emulator for https://www.nulled.to/authkeys. Made By https://github.com/FaxHack

# How it works

It starts a HTTPS Server, using NetCoreServer, after it modifies the Hosts File, to allow HTTPS Redirection.

It generates a valid response, with random credentials. It also uses Max Rank possible, Aqua+ (Worth 60 $).

# IS THAT A BYPASS?

NO. This program IS NOT a Nulled.to Bypass, as its purpose is only to emulate the Nulled.to Auth Server, and this can be done by every program, or even manually!

So please, do not call my Emulator, a "Bypass", because you would spread false information.

It is not Nulled.to's fault. They provide a great Auth system.

THIS IS NOT THE SAME EMULATION AS Nulled.to Auth "BYPASSES". THE TERM EMULATION HERE REFERS TO "EMULATING" A PUBLIC SERVER BY USING THE SAME Nulled.to Auth APPLICATION INFORMATION TO MAKE THIS TOOL LOOKS LIKE THE SERVER. IT DOES NOT INTERACT WITH THE PROGRAM'S MEMORY IN ANY WAY.

# How to use

- Run "CertificateBypass.pfx".

- Select "Local PC".

- Insert the password: "shiba".

- Add it to the Trusted Root CA Folder.

- Press enter.

- Now you can start the Emulator without a problem.

# Requirement's

# DMCA VIOLATIONS
Does this project violate DMCA? Not.

This program only shows a method that can be done manually without any problem. It is a clone of the original nulled.to auth Server. This can be done by everyone, and it does not interact with Process Memory.

It does not modify programs in any way.
